# RUSTSEC-2024-0436: paste crate declared unmaintained
# Rationale: paste is a proc-macro by dtolnay (highly trusted maintainer)
# that is feature-complete and widely used. "Unmaintained" does not mean
# vulnerable - it's simply no longer under active development.
# Transitive dependency: reactive_stores → paste

# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa timing sidechannel vulnerability
# Rationale: This is a stale Cargo.lock entry. The rsa crate is NOT actually
# used in our dependency tree. It appears because sqlx's Cargo.toml lists
# sqlx-mysql as a dependency, but we use `default-features = false` to exclude
# it. Cargo.lock preserves these unused entries for reproducibility.
# Verified with: cargo tree --all-features | grep rsa (returns nothing)
