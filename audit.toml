# RUSTSEC-2024-0436: paste crate declared unmaintained
# Rationale: paste is a proc-macro by dtolnay (highly trusted maintainer)
# that is feature-complete and widely used. "Unmaintained" does not mean
# vulnerable - it's simply no longer under active development.
# Transitive dependency: reactive_stores → paste
