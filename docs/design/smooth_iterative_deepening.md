title: Smooth Iterative Deepening
subtitle: Noet's fundamental philosophy
---

With humanoid robots and autonomous cars growing ever closer to consumer adoption, it is more
important than ever to develop a shared understanding of what it means to live in a world saturated
with automation. It is inevitable that our personal identity and cognitive capacity becomes
increasingly extended into the world at-large. As-is, most people feel like part of themselves is
missing if they don't have their phone on them. This extending of our selves into the environment is
nothing new, humans have been doing it for millennia through forms as diverse as road and building
construction, language, clothing, and tool making. What is new is how we are now extending ourselves
into substrates we have so little personal control over. What does it mean to our sense of selves
when essential pieces of our personality are synonymous with what brands we support? Are you an
Android or an Apple User? Do you drive a Ford or Chevy? What happens when we stop controlling the
*form* of our lives and simply control the labels of those forms? It used to be with cars that you
could modify them, making hot-rods or other bespoke forms that actually reflected a piece of your
personality. Now, lacking the resources or even right to repair the technology we purchase,
increasing portions of our personal identity are vassal to what global brands offer to us.

What is missing is the right and expectation that our technology adhere to a protocol of "Smooth,
Iterative Deepening". This term was coined in [[an
essay](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/03/10/rust-2025-intro/) by Niko
Matsakis. In it, he describes the experience as follows:

> **Smooth, iterative deepening**
>
> The other lesson I’ve learned is that you want to enable what I think of as smooth, iterative
> deepening. This rather odd phrase is the one that always comes to my mind, somehow. The idea is
> that a user’s first experience should be simple---they should be able to get up and going
> quickly. As they get further into their project, the user will find places where it’s not doing
> what they want, and they’ll need to take control. They should be able to do this in a localized
> way, changing one part of their project without disturbing everything else.
>
> Smooth, iterative deepening sounds easy but is in fact very hard. Many projects fail either
> because the initial experience is hard or because the step from simple-to-control is in fact more
> like scaling a cliff, requiring users to learn a lot of background material.

This term points to the unavoidable tension between simplicity versus specificity that practitioners
face within any complex environment.

With most digital technology, the user's ability to take control of the process is limited or
non-existent. When what's at stake is a toy, service, or commodity then how smoothly, iteratively,
or deeply the consumer can take control of the product does not matter because it is not
existential. Where this property really matters is when the product category starts to define who
the product owner is in terms of their personal identity as well as objective capabilities. The area
I am increasinly concerned by is the growing category of "smart" devices such as smart phones, smart
homes, smart cars, smart watches, as well as the soon-to-be ubiquitous category of AI assistants.

Noet, and noet-core, aim to be a possible operating system of sorts that enables participants to better interface with the world according to this principle of smooth iterative deepening. As such, the project itself should respect this principle. This means: getting started should be easy, and the system continuously unfolds in complexity and possibility from there. There should be no insurmountable walls of complexity, be it in terms of learning, "getting permission", or accessing resources that prevent a participant from fully pursuing an idea or goal they have.

# Tension between risk and reward

# Tension between personal virtuosity and pedagogical responsibility
